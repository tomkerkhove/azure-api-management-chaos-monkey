# Azure API Management - Chaos Monkey üêí

Bringing chaos to your Azure API Management gateways üêí

## What chaos does it bring?

A sample that will automatically simulate gateway failures by randomly enabling/disabling a gateway in a given location.

This allows you to simulate gateway failures and see how your platform reacts to it and how it recovers.

## Deployment

You can deploy the sample to an Azure Container App as following:

```shell
az deployment group create --resource-group building-resilient-api-platform --template-file ./deploy/azure-container-apps.bicep --parameters appId=c609aad8-d5b0-46f0-8e26-8a0f3224723f --parameters tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47 --parameters appSecret=foo
```
