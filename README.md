# Azure API Management - Chaos Monkey 🐒

Bringing chaos to your Azure API Management gateways 🐒

## What chaos does it bring?

A sample that will automatically simulate gateway failures by randomly enabling/disabling a gateway in a given location.

This allows you to simulate gateway failures and see how your platform reacts to it and how it recovers.
